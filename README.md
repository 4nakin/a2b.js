I have been developing code for many years as a full time developer and hobbiest.

My career took me in the direction of corporate software, but I have always harboured a love of developing games too.  Behind me is a trail of half baked/half finished ideas for games/utitilies over the years.

I have normally found the best way to learn a technology or language is to dive in with a "real" project and not just follow the clinical examples presented in a book/online.
